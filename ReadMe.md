# SHRCC System

Welcome to the SHRCC System! This project was developed as part of a group effort during the Codi Tech Bootcamp. I was responsible for working on the front-end part of the system.

## Project Overview

The SHRCC System is designed for a medical center, addressing the challenges of patient management and follow-up. The system not only streamlines the process of adding and managing patients but also incorporates functionalities to predict potential health issues.

## Getting Started

To run the SHRCC System locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install Node Modules:**
   ```bash
   npm install --force
   ```

2. **Run the App:**
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
The app will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

## About Medical Center Systems
Medical Center Systems are crucial tools for healthcare facilities, assisting in the efficient management of patient records, appointments, and overall healthcare operations.

In the context of this project, the SHRCC System focuses on:

- Efficient patient record management.
- Streamlined processes for adding and following up with patients.
- Implementation of predictive functionalities for early health issue detection.
